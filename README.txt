To run application, unzip folder, then open folder in Bash (or a terminal of your choice) and execute with 
./NameSortingApp ./unsorted-names-list.txt
Sorted names will appear in sorted-names-list.txt

Feel free to replace the names in the unsorted names list. 
Make sure that you have all the contents of the folder (the .dll, the .exe and the .runtimeconfig.json) in the same file location as they are required for the program to work.
