To run application, open folder in Bash (or a terminal of your choice) and execute with 
./NameSortingApp ./unsorted-names-list.txt


Make sure that you have all the contents of the folder (the .dll, the .exe and the .runtimeconfig.json) in the same file location as they are required for the program to work.
